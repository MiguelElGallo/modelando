## A quick Introduction
Modelando, meaning "modeling" in Spanish. A bilingual repository (English, Spanish) to collaborate on important concepts related to data modeling. 
I will start with some thoughts and hopefully get some interest and contributions that can influence where to go.

My initial thought for this initiative was approximately five years ago. 

A customer asked me to prepare training for Power BI for a group of controllers (accountants) that had started to use Power BI with great results, but now they wanted to take it to the next level. 

They gave me good feedback on how I presented Dimension and Facts. 

Now I decided to remember how I did it and make it available to everyone, hoping it helps more people and sparks collaboration.
